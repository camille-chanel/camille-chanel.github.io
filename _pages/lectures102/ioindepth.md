## I/O Beyond the Basics
While cin and cout make printing and reading in data very easy in C++, there are all sorts of topics on input/output to cover beyond the basics with C++. This lecture will cover error checking with cin, reading chars, cin.ignore(), and printf.

## In-Depth on Cin

### Error Checking with cin

### Cin.get()

## In-Depth on Cout

### I/O Manipulation (put in separate page)
Manipulators are tools that allow us to edit streams (i.e. output streams, file streams, etc) to polish our formatting. Some examples of I/O manipulation would be left-justifying text, or rounding data to a particular decimal place. Manipulators are found in \<iostream> and \<iomanip>.

#### \<iostream> Manipulators
-endl "terminate the output line"
-fixed "Display in decimal point format with 6 decimal places as default" (scientific notation is the default)
-showpoint "display a whole number in decimal format with 6 significant digits as default"
-noshowpoint (undoes showpoint)
-precision ???
Is powerpoint wrong with fixed, scientific?
